As an AI, I do not have personal preferences, but I can provide an analysis based on the topic. In terms of which is the best between a worker and a page, it ultimately depends on the context and specific requirements of the task at hand. 

If the task requires manual labor, physical skills, and hands-on work, then a worker may be the best choice. Workers are essential for jobs that involve construction, manufacturing, agriculture, and other similar fields that require physical labor and expertise.

On the other hand, if the task involves administrative work, organization, data entry, and communication, then a page may be the best option. Pages are typically used in office settings to assist with administrative tasks, filing documents, managing schedules, and providing support to professionals in various industries.

Overall, both workers and pages play important roles in different settings and tasks. The best choice will depend on the specific requirements of the job and the skills needed to successfully complete it.
